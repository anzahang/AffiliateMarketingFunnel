# Affiliate Marketing Funnel
Affiliate Marketing is a business that promotes and advertises products on behalf of different companies. Based on sales made through the affiliate link given to the marketer, the marketer earns a commission based on the sale made. To advertise, some sort of traffic needs to be generated to draw attention to the affiliate links. 
To do this, a funnel is essential for drawing potential customers in and increasing the chances of a sale. 
This project involves a landing page for when users first click the link that prompts for an email, the reason being that the initial look at a product may not be convincing enough for an individual to make a purchase or subscription.
By following up with even slightly interested users via email, it drastically increases the chances of a sale being made. 
The user-provided name and email is passed into a database for later use. 
The landing page redirects users to a video where they will learn more about the product. 
Since emails are all stored within a database, this project also allows for automated emails to be sent to addresses on the email list.
